# Jarvis - Final Project from Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science CS50 hosted on eDX

Jarvis is a virtual assistant. He can talk and solve problems for you. 

### What did I use to build it

I used Python for the logic and PyQt5 to make the Graphical User Interface.

Frameworks I used:

- speech recognition
- pyttsx3
- pywhatkit
- wikipedia
- pyjokes
- randfacts
- winshell
- requests
- datetime
- os
- webbrowser
- PyQt5
- PyQt5-tools

### Video Demo:

For the CS50 final project you have to make a video showing your project: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnZ1uWIjtXY)

### Description:

You can use for example the following functions of Jarvis.

- Greeting
- Ask the current date
- Ask the current time
- Play a Song (on Youtube)
- Open Programs
- Open websites
- Get the latest news
- Get a random joke
- Get a random fact
- Empty recycle bin
- Get Wikipedia summaries
- Write notes
- Show notes
- restart PC
- Sign off
- Get Locations
- Get Google search results

#### Files
the main File contains almost all the logic of the program.
gui.py was made with PyQt5 and QT Designer. I used it to build the GUI for Jarvis.
JarvisGUI.py connects the GUI with all the logic of the main.py file.


## Installation

- First fork this repo by clicking the button on top right corner
- Then Clone the repo in your local machine
- Navigate to the directory of your project
- Install all the requirements which I stated before
- Run the python script named as main.py which is in Jarvis Directory.
- Now Enjoy with your own assistant :)

## About CS50
CS50 is a course from Harvard University and taught by David J. Malan

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus studentsâ€™ choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development).

Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.
